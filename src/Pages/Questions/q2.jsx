            <p className='text1'>No. The laws applicable to PayPulp accounts differ by country, 
            so you can't change your address to a country that is different from the country you used when you opened your account. 
            If you're moving abroad, youâ€™ll need to close your existing account and open a new account. 
            If you maintain residences in 2 countries, you can have 2 PayPulp accounts as long as only one is a Business account.
